# Pyber_Analysis

# Overview
* The purpose of this analysis was to indentify business trends within different geographics of "rural", "suburban" and "urban" areas in terms of relationships between "drivers" and "fares."
* These patterns were demonstrated with different data visualizations.

# Results
* The analysis of the data shows that there is a correlation between geographic region and number of rides. This means that urbans areas with a higher density of population take part in more rides, while more rural areas with smaller populations have far less rides recorded. Suburban areas met in the middle of both rural and ubran regions.
* Rual had 125 rides and suburban had 625 rides while urban areas had 1625 rides over the same time duration.

* These results came from ride-sharing data that included the total number of rides, total number of drivers, total dolalr amount of fares, average dollar amount of fare per ride and driver, and total dollar amount of fare by city type.
* This data was used to compare the 3 different geopgrahical regions by look ing at "total ride count", "total dolalr amount of fares", "total number of drivers",

# Summary
* After reviewing the data
* There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

In order to make ride-sharing more accessible across city types, 
it would be necessary to implement a ride-sharing infrastructure that could seamlessly connect the three regions. 
It would also be of importance that the service is affordable for all riders coming to or from any city. 
These services need to be accessible in terms of affordability and also in commuting time, as it's likely that high costs or commute times would discourage riders from using these services as their primary method of transportation
